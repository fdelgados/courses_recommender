# Courses recommendations site
This is the fifth part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree capstone project, which consists in the creation of a course recommendation system.

## How to use the courses recommendations demo web

### Home page

Go to [https://courses-recommender.herokuapp.com/](https://courses-recommender.herokuapp.com/) and the home page looks like that:

<img alt="Home page" src="https://github.com/fdelgados/recommendations-web/blob/master/img/home_screenshot.png"/>

In the home page we make three types of rank-based recommendations:
    
* Most often requested courses, on the left
* Top rated courses, on the right
* Top ten categories sorted by number of requests and average rating
    
### Catalog page
Click on [Catalog](https://courses-recommender.herokuapp.com/catalog) on the top right of the page:

![Catalog](../img/catalog_page.png)

The main container is a list of courses sorted by number of requests. You can change the order of the list by clicking on "Rating"
on the left sidebar.

![Sort buttons](../img/sort_buttons.png)

In addition to the sorting buttons, in the left sidebar, there is a list of categories. By clicking on any of them, you can filter the list by categories.

![Categories](../img/categories.png)

### Course page
This is the course page:

![Course page](../img/course_page.png)

After course description, you can see four blocks of recommendations:

* The block *Users who requested information about this were also interested in* recommends courses based on leads generated
by other users that also generated a lead on this course.
* The block *You may also be interested in* makes three types of recommendations: on the left, most often requested courses belonging to the same category as the current course.
In the middle, the most valued courses in the category. And on the right, a list of similar courses by content.

### Requesting information

You can request information about any course by clicking on the "Request information" button, then you must enter your email and click on "Submit"
